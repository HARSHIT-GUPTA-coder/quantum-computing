\section{Measurement}
The projective measurement is shown in the circuit by the meter symbol. Since any measurement can be expressed in the form of unitary matrix and projective measurement, we will not define any symbol for general measurements. \\
There are two very important principles about measurement in quantum circuit.//
{\bf Principle of deferred measurement: }Measurements can always be moved from an intermediate stage of a quantum circuit to the end of the circuit; if the measurement results are used at any stage of the circuit then the classically controlled operations can be replaced by conditional quantum operations.\\
{\bf Principle of implicit measurement: }Without loss of generality, any unterminated quantum wires (qubits which are not measured) at the end of a quantum circuit may be assumed to be measured.\\\\
The measurements act as a link between the classical world and the quantum world. The measurements as the only way we can retrieve the information from a quantum system. Hence, measurements are very important part of any system.
