# quantum-computing
This repository contains my notes on quantum computing which I studied during Summer 2020 under Summer of Science.

The topics include a brief introduction to the classical models, basics of quantum mechanics and quantum computing, and ending at various quantum algorithms known at present.

You can find the same files in this [https://www.overleaf.com/read/mpgkvcrkbzsh](overleaf project).
